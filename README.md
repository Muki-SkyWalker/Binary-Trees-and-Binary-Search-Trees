- What is a Binary Tree ?
	A tree is an undirected graph which satisfies any of the following definitions:
		- A acyclic (means there are no cycles)  connected graph
		- A connected graph with N nodes and N-1 edges
		- A groph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path.

	A child is a node extending from another node. A parent is the inverse of this.

	A leaf node is a node with no children. These have been higlighted in orange.
